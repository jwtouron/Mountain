*** How to make a PR to Mountain
- Make a fork of the Mountain repository
- Write or modify a theme for a program with the Mountain palette
- Commit themes to the ~[program_name]/~ folder in your fork of the repository
- Open a PR. Make sure the PR name tells us the program name
- Wait for someone to approve or suggest tweaks (or make some themselves)
- PR is merged!

*Again, please ensure that all your work, or work you are using is licensed under compatible, open-source licenses.*
